“I, Olga Hepnarová, 
the victim of your bestiality, sentence you to death.”

–  –  Olga Hepranova…. (1951 – 1975 )



























Olga was a beautiful fool. Her so self-declared form of ‘sentencing’ led to her own sentencing, and made it to the records as the last female execution in Czechoslovakia.
As I stand in the middle of the footbridge and looked down below, morning crowd has already set to their daily mission. I stare at the cigarette and the fingers holding it, then the cars, one after another over my thumbnail. I’m not beautiful and fool like Olga, I’m not going to take a truck and drive over some oldies and wait for police and waste the rest of my life. I will always have more to offer to this society. The way it has shaped me throughout all these years, pushed me and pulled me to its own design, I never wanted to surface onto,  slowly tattooed its own lines on my skin, I need to start cleaning… Soon..

I looked at the crowd again, its hard now a days to differentiate people from people. Everyone is on an uniform, they talk same , smile on same words, cry on same disappointment, they cut their hairs in similar fashion, try similar clothes, do same things every day and day after day.  I looked at my watch, Its time. Its time to jump into the systematic chaos again, its time to catch a bus for my office and I have an extra half an hour. 30 mins I will wait or 30 mins will wait for me, if not today someday…
I checked my handbag for the things I need, a 500CA approcating my stop.

I was eager, maybe a way too much to come back to my bed, my home, that two room-set, my own temple. I was not feeling guilty, not feeling proud, just excited to feel normal again. As soon as I reach, I threw myself on the stinky bed, then threw my clothes and bag around. A joint, kept ready, right by the pillow. I need to find the matchbox now, the most unlikely thing to find in this mess, but before that, I need that picture, it was printed in black and white on an A4 sheet, it’s a still from Aktulane TV,back in ’73. There she is smiling with her eyes digging deep into mine, her most evergreen look in the world of black-n-white. And she is right under my pillow. I hold her up, in front of my eyes, smell the raw weed from the unburnt joint while looking at her, I do not feel guilty, do not feel proud, just felt normal. Whatever is been done today, maybe I kill just an ant to extinguish a forest, but it’s a start, soon I will burn down some trees. All the wrongs been done to her, all the wrongs she did, made her whisper something right into my ear --  "If the society destroys individuals, individuals can destroy the society."
